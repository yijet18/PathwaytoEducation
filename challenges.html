      <h2>1. Digital Divide & Urban–Rural Gap</h2>
      <p>According to the Ministry of Education, the Digital Competency Score (DCS) for 2023 was 3.24/5 for rural students, compared to 3.34/5 for urban students. In terms of infrastructure, MoE said 10,237 schools have broadband access (30–300 Mbps), but the technology provision is being rolled out in phases. There are about 432 “ultra micro” primary schools (with fewer than 30 students) across Malaysia, many of them in rural areas.</p>

      <h2>2. Declining Student Performance (PISA / TIMSS)</h2>
      <p>According to analysis by ISIS Malaysia, Malaysia’s PISA scores declined in the 2022 assessment. Specifically, they estimate this decline is equivalent to “nearly 1.6 years of lost learning in mathematics, 1.4 years in reading, and 1.1 years in science.”. In older TIMSS data (from the Education Blueprint), only 1–2% of Malaysian students reach the “highest benchmark level” (e.g., complex problem-solving) in maths/science.</p>

        <h2>3. Socioeconomic and Equity Disparities</h2>
        <p>In terms of facility access, some rural and low-income (B40) students lack adequate infrastructure; for example, the social structure shows that B40 students are more often in rural schools, which tend to have fewer resources.</p>

        <h2>4. Infrastructure Condition</h2>
        <p>According to a report cited by GA Excellence, between 2016-2019 there were about 633 schools categorized as being in “Poor Condition”, many of them in rural areas.</p>
