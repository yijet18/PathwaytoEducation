     <h2>Education path in Malaysia</h2>
     <p>Malaysia’s education system is divided into early childhood, primary, secondary, post-secondary, tertiary, and lifelong learning. It is overseen mainly by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE).</p>

        <h2>1. Early Childhood Education (Ages 0–6)</h2>
        <p>Early childhood education in Malaysia consists of taska (nursery) and tadika (kindergarten). Taska caters to children from birth up to 4 years old, providing childcare and early developmental activities. Tadika serves children aged 4–6 and focuses on preparing them for primary school through basic literacy, numeracy, social skills, and emotional development. While not compulsory, attendance at early childhood programs is highly encouraged, as research shows it significantly improves school readiness and long-term academic outcomes.</p>

        <h2>2. Primary Education (Standard 1–6, Ages 7–12)</h2>
        <p>Primary education is the first formal stage of schooling and is compulsory for all Malaysian children. It spans six years, from Standard 1 to Standard 6, and is provided in several types of schools: Sekolah Kebangsaan (SK) for national schools, SJK(C) for Chinese national-type schools, and SJK(T) for Tamil national-type schools. The curriculum emphasizes core subjects such as Malay, English, mathematics, science, history, and moral or Islamic studies. Assessment is primarily school-based since the UPSR examination was abolished in 2021, allowing a more continuous evaluation of students’ learning progress.</p>

        <h2>3. Secondary Education (Form 1–5, Ages 13–17)</h2>
        <p>Secondary education is divided into lower secondary (Forms 1–3) and upper secondary (Forms 4–5). In lower secondary, students follow a broad curriculum and are assessed through school-based evaluations, as the PT3 exam was abolished in 2021. In upper secondary, students select streams according to their interests and career goals: science, arts/humanities, technical/vocational, or religious studies. At the end of Form 5, students take the SPM (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia) examination, which is a critical determinant for entering pre-university, vocational, or diploma programs.</p>

        <h2>4. Post-Secondary / Pre-University (After SPM)</h2>
        <p>After completing SPM, students have several options for post-secondary education. They may pursue pre-university programs such as STPM (two-year national A-level equivalent), Matriculation (one-year government program), or Asasi/Foundation courses at public or private universities. International alternatives like A-Levels, International Baccalaureate (IB), and AUSMAT are also available. Another path is the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) route, which emphasizes practical skills and leads to certificates, diplomas, or national qualifications (SKM). Students may also directly enter the workforce and later opt for part-time or distance learning.</p>
        <p1>Example pre-universities in Malaysia are Taylor's College, Kolej Tuanku Ja'afar (KTJ) and Kolej Yayasan UEM (KYUEM)</p1>

        <h2>5. Diploma Programs</h2>
        <p>Diplomas in Malaysia are typically 2–3 years long and offered by polytechnics, colleges, and some universities. They focus on specific professional or technical skills, allowing students to specialize in areas such as engineering, business, or IT. Diploma holders may progress directly to degree programs, often entering Year 2 of a bachelor’s program if the credits are recognized. This pathway bridges the gap between secondary education and higher education while providing employable skills.</p>
        <p1>Some of the most famous diploma programs in Malaysia are in fields like Business, Information Technology (IT), and Engineering.</p1>

        <h2>6. Tertiary / Higher Education</h2>
        <p>Tertiary education in Malaysia includes public universities (IPTA), private universities/colleges (IPTS), polytechnics, and colleges. Bachelor’s degrees usually take 3–4 years to complete, depending on the field of study, followed by master’s degrees (1–2 years) and PhDs (3–5 years) for postgraduate study. Public universities are competitive and research-focused, whereas private institutions often offer more flexible programs and international partnerships. Tertiary education aims to develop critical thinking, professional expertise, and research capabilities.</p>
        <p1>Some of Malaysia's most famous universities include Universiti Malaya, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, and Universiti Sains Malaysia.</p1>

        <h2>7. Lifelong Learning</h2>
        <p>Malaysia also emphasizes lifelong learning through professional certifications, adult education, micro-credentials, and distance learning. Institutions like Open University Malaysia (OUM) provide flexible programs for adults or working professionals seeking to upgrade skills. Additionally, programs under TVET and professional bodies such as ACCA or HRDF support ongoing skill development. Lifelong learning ensures that Malaysians can continuously adapt to changing job markets and technological advancements.</p>
        <p1>Many famous Malaysian universities and colleges offer lifelong learning opportunities, including public institutions like Universiti Malaya, Universiti Sains Malaysia, and Universiti Utara Malaysia, as well as private institutions such as Open University Malaysia, SEGi University, Taylor's University, and Asia Pacific University (APU). </p1>
